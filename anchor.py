DoughForge
A publishing pipeline for independent authors, built on the W-Anchor Protocol.

What This Is
DoughForge is a book project and a toolkit. It contains:

The manuscript — The Conquest of DoughForge
The pipeline — Pandoc builds producing EPUB, PDF, and DOCX from one Markdown source
The anchor — anchor.py, a path verifier that keeps every session grounded
Quick Start
Run this to check your build environment is working:

python anchor.py
Build commands:

pandoc publication\your_book.md -o outputs\your_book.docx
pandoc publication\your_book.md --epub-cover-image="assets\cover\front_cover.jpg" -o outputs\your_book.epub
pandoc publication\your_book.md --pdf-engine=lualatex --include-in-header=preamble.tex -o outputs\your_book.pdf
The W-Anchor Protocol
Context drift is what happens when an AI assistant forgets what you agreed on three hours ago. The W-Anchor Protocol prevents it by keeping a single document — ANCHOR.md — that both human and AI read at the start of every session.

Full documentation: ANCHOR.md
