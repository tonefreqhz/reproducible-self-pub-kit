# 2) Ground Truth: one manuscript, many outputs

Publishing pain usually comes from one root cause:

You stop knowing which file is the truth.

So we pick a truth and make everything else a rebuildable product of that truth.

The Ground Truth rule
One canonical manuscript (this Markdown file).

Everything else is generated: PDF, EPUB, DOCX, cover embeds, metadata exports.

If an output looks wrong, you do not fix the output. You fix the manuscript (or the build rules) and rebuild.

This isnt ideology. Its how you keep launch day boring.

What counts as canonical (and what doesnt)
Canonical (edit these):

publication/pamphlet_issue_1.md

any images referenced by the manuscript (covers, diagrams)

build scripts/templates you actually control (if used)

Artifacts (rebuild these):

outputs/.pdf

outputs/.epub

outputs/*.docx

If you can regenerate it, dont treat it like source.

The Anchor connection (no mysticism, just receipts)
Your ANCHOR.md is the contract that keeps you honest:

the repo layout you expect
the commands that should work
the checks you run when reality starts drifting
When youre tired, obvious becomes expensive. Anchor files are cheap insurance.
