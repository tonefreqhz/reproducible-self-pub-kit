> ⚠️ **BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING — HUMAN OR AI — RUN THIS:**
>
> ```powershell
> cd "<YOUR_REPO_ROOT>"
> .\anchor_verify.ps1
> ```
>
> Paste the full output into your AI chat before typing a single instruction.
> If every line says `[OK]` you are anchored. If anything says `[MISSING]` stop and fix it first.
> An AI that has not seen this output is **not anchored** and will drift.
